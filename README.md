An Empirical Study of Global Home Broadband Networks: Availability, Infrastructure, and Usage
==================

Draft for bismark passive IMC paper

TODO:
- remove findings from Intro - difficult to parse
- where to put TERMINOLOGY subsection
- should we refer to bismark, sigcomm paper?
- confirm dataset dates for Heartbeats, Devices, WiFi, Passive, Throughput
- add "bismark" section in "data collection" focussing on bismark-passive
- "availability" section para 1 repetition with "data" section
- Add more plots like figure 3: diurnal pattern in China
- Can compare diurnal pattern of outage to diurnal patterns of utilization
- Scatter plot against GDP - outage duration
- a section on what we can detect using different signatures
- conclusion is too ubicompy at the moment
- fig2 update - sarthak
- fig4 update - joon
- fig9: can include detailed plots of active capacity v/s passive bitrate for few - sarthak
- fig10 update - sarthak
- fig11 update - miseon
